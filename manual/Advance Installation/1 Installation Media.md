# Installation Media
To start off our installation, we will be flashing a usb with the Arch Linux ISO.
  
I will assume that the reader has already installed Linux at least once, and understand the basics. Thus, the proceeding steps may involve code and that may have dangerous side effects (such as corrupt data). Always backup your data before installing something new or performing a new operation.
