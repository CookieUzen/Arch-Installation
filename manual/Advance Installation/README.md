# Advance Installation

_So, you did it._
  
Installed Linux with the installation guide. It wasn't that bad now, was it? Care for a challenge? The guide below will go through installing Linux with one of the more difficult processes. We will be installing _Arch Linux_, a flexible distribution that Manjaro is based on. Instead of having a GUI installer, or even a TUI installer (like in Manjaro Architect) [1], you have to do everything manually. Typing in commands into a terminal. Although scary at first, it gets easier. Installing Arch Linux manually teaches you many valuable lessons about Linux. Arch Linux is also a great distribution overall. It's hands on approach gives you freedom in your choice of software. Whenever you have trouble, you can visit the Arch Wiki. Arguably the best well maintained wiki on Linux. Heck, I am writing this guide on an Arch Linux machine.
  
I have to warn you though, it's not easy. I myself been through many failed installation. But the reward is immense. 


## Footnotes
1. Actually, Manjaro Architect is based off the famous [Architect](http://landoflinux.com/linux_install_architect_linux.html) installer for Arch Linux. There is also the [Zen Installer](https://github.com/spookykidmm/zen_installer).
