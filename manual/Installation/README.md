# Linux
For many students, Linux has always been a name buzzing around the Internet. Often heard of, but something in the distance. The untouchable and the invisible. This is most likely because the word *Linux* is associated with nerds and computer geeks. Often perceived as a difficult, hard to use Operating Settings. However, as Linux develops, **this is simply not the case.** 
  
This guide aims to provide a easy starting point for willing students to installing Linux on your computer.

## Why Use Linux?
There are many benefits of using Linux as a _consumer_.  

### Price
Most well known OSes are commercial. Meaning that companies produce software and create the operating system for the end user. However, this means a lot of the time, these software cost money. For example, Microsoft requires purchasing a license for the installation of windows, Adobe requires a monthly subscription to gain access to their suit of softwares. 
  
Linux on the other hand is open sourced. This means that it is made by the community, for the community. This means that the majority of programs are created with the indention of sharing in mind. This means that the softwares are usually free. Although it is not as professional as their Windows counterparts, Linux software can also be quite advance. Drawing applications like Krita and GIMP can replace Adobe software (at a non professional level) quite easily. Free video editors such as Olive is catching up to its paid rivals. Using Linux means saving a lot of money, while still retaining high quality software.

### Fast
Linux also have a strong focus on efficiency. Programs are designed to be modular, work together and as light as possible. 
- lightweight
- improves battery
- support for old hardware (due to little processing power needed)

### Support
- Lots of Help Online (From many active forums members)
- well documented (great wikis online if you are willing to read them)

### Stability
- safe (less virus)
- less breakdowns versus other Operating Systems.

### Easy Management
- Package Managers (allows for easy installation)
- backup (secure)
- dotfiles (allow for easy set up and advance setting tweaking)

### Personal
- Own configuration (high amounts of reconfigurability)

## Special Note
**Learning Linux is not a one day task:** you will not be able to do everything in a day. To fully understand and use Linux, a lot of time is needed to be invested into learning and research. However, *the benefits outweighs the time spent*. Refer to the previous section (*Why Use Linux*) or reference.

## Further Research
This guide assumes some basic knowledge on computers and the shell. Since this is a compacted guide explaining a large amount of information, further research is required to familiarize yourself with the large variety of software provided. The guide will, however provide reading material or good sources. 

### Wiki and Man Pages
When there is a lack of information, always look to the **man pages**. They provide a lot of important information (`man [program]` or `[program] -h`). When the *man pages* aren't enough, one can always look to Wikis. The [Arch Linux Wiki](wiki.archlinux.org) and [Manjaro Wiki](wiki.manjaro.org) can help greatly.

### Community
Linux has a growing community that is willing to help. Forums like [reddit (r/linux)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/) and [Manjaro Forum](forum.manjaro.org) can help greatly. Just remember to read the guidelines before posting an questions. No one likes to answer dumb questions!

### Google
Last but not least, if you have any problems, you can always Google them up. There is a high chance that someone has already asked the same question as you online, or a website wrote a guide about it.
