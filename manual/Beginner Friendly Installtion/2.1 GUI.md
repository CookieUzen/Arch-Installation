# GUI Installation
You have just sticked the USB in your computer, and booted into Linux. In front of you is a brilliant new world! Here, you can mess around and see what everything look like. Try some of the tools, fiddle around with the folders and files. This is your last change before you commit and install Linux.
  
After you are done having a look around, follow the installtion instructions and install Linux! [1]
