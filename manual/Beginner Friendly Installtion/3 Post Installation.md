# Post Installation

## Tools

So now that we are done with installing Linux, we need to install some tools to help you with the everyday task. Unlike Windows and Macs, Linux is not as mainstream. Although support is getting better, many tools and applications you can see on Windows (and Mac) is not found on Linux. But that doesn't mean that Linux is a wasteland devote of any tools. In fact, some many argue Linux has more and better tools for everyday uses. 
  
The folder _Tools_ will show you several useful applications that will aid you in doing your everyday tasks. 

## Shell Scripting

Although Linux is not mainstream on personal computers, many server computers around the world actually runs on Linux. Why? Because Linux is inherently powerful. The openness of it's system and well designed structure allows for a customizability that no operating system can match. You can leverage this to your advantage by learning how to use the _"terminal"_. The terminal (or more accurately, the shell) is a place where commands string together, allowing you to do anything you want. You can learn more about it [here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/).

## Ricing

Due to Linux being such a customizable system, there are many people who took it upon themselves to make their computer _truely there's_. On Linux, this is commonly referred to as **Ricing**. Unlike other operating systems, Linux provide you with the ability to tear apart each layer of your machine. From your Desktop Environment to your Sound Server. Allowing you to tweak each individual settings to perfection. Many people change the color, appearance and logo of their computers. Some add additional programs and key binds. The sky is the limit. You can have a look at [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) and see what's possible.
