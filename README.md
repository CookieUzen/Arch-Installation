# Arch-Installation

Welcome to a part guide, part dotfiles repository! This repository includes a comprehensive guide to installing Linux and the components it is made of. It is essentially a beginner friendly wiki.
  
## Manual
In this folder, I will go through an standard installation of Linux. I mainly cover the distro Manjaro and Arch Linux, yet the instructions are broad enough that you will help with any distro you prefer to use.
  
If you are a beginner, and perform your first installation of Linux, click [here](./manual/Installation/README.md).
  
If you are have some experience with Unix based system, and would like to perform a more challenging Linux installation, click [here](/manual/Advance Installation/README.md).
  
If you have an existing Linux installation and want to _rice it_ (make it cooler and better), click [here](./manual/Ricing/README.md)
  
If you have an existing installation and would like to find some quality software (and some documentation on how to use them), click [here](./manual/Tools/README.md).

## Dotfiles
In this folder, I have a copy of my dotfiles for certain programs. The dotfiles
contain a decent amount of comments to explain the settings and you may draw
some inspiration from them.
  
I am also working on a bootstrap program. Which would install suitable programs and dotfiles (sensible dotfiles) on a Arch based distro. It would allow you to quickly step up a decent system to tinker with, or simply save time when installing Linux on a new computer. This program takes inspiration from [Luke Smith's LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS).

## A Disclaimer
I am a high school student. I am a very new Linux user. I fell in love with Linux about half a year ago. Where I started out with using Manjaro i3. Yet, I am very passionate, and have been doing a lot of exploring. This repository is a sum of my research and efforts.
  
But because I am no professional programmer or long time Linux user, take my advice with a grain of salt. Backup your files before typing commands from this repository as maybe sometime (hopefully never) something will go wrong.
