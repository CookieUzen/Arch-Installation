# Before We Begin

## Distributions
There are many Linux distributions (distro). Each distribution is like a version of Linux, offering it's own features and uses. Some distributions are more feature heavy, while others are designed to be fast. 
  
We will be using *Manjaro* for our guide. Manjaro is a Arch-based distro (based on Arch Linux) that provides easy installation and more sensible defaults. Compared to other distributions, it has a great package manager (for downloading trusted software), it is easily customizable (Arch-based) and have an easy installation compared to Arch Linux.
  
For more information on different distributions, visit [itsfoss](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-distributions/). However, keep in mind that no distribution is the most superior. All distributions have it's own advantages and disadvantages.

## Desktop Environment
This guide will assume an installation with the KDE Plasma and i3 Desktop Environment (DE). Desktop environments provide a group of software that creates the "look" of an system. Oftentimes setting logos, interfaces, and more. A DE is not as important as choosing a Linux Distro, but it does effect the user comfort. 

## Requirements
Linux itself is an extremely resources light, it is capable of running on almost any hardware. Also, we will be running a lightweight distribution and DE, so really you can transform any computer into a Linux machine. Although be aware that if you do use a slow computer, some processor intensive tasks such as bluring background can cause severe lag.
  
Also, when using Apple computers, some additional settings and configurations may need to be installed. Extra time may need to be put in to ensure a successful installation.
